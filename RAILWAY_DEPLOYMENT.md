## ðŸŽ¯ Why Railway?

- âœ… **Native Express.js support** - No serverless conversion needed
- âœ… **Persistent connections** - Perfect for real-time features
- âœ… **Simple deployment** - Just connect GitHub and deploy
- âœ… **Auto-scaling** - Handles traffic spikes automatically
- âœ… **Built-in monitoring** - Logs, metrics, and health checks

## ðŸ”§ Build Configuration

Railway will automatically:
1. Detect Node.js project
2. Run `npm install`
3. Execute `npm run build`
4. Start with `npm start`

The application will be available on port 5000 (or Railway's assigned port).

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results

After deployment, you'll have:
- âœ… **Frontend**: React app served at root URL
- âœ… **API**: All endpoints available at `/api/*`
- âœ… **Database**: Connected to Neon PostgreSQL
- âœ… **Payments**: Stripe integration working
- âœ… **Health Check**: Available at `/api/health`

The loading screen issue will be resolved because the Express server will run continuously on Railway, unlike Vercel's serverless limitations.
